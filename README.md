You have got a data sample of user's monthly activity between January and April 2018. Users could have joined our app between 2017-06-01 till 2018-04-30 which is represented in the first_install_date dimension. In addition to that you also know whether or not a user has a favourite team or not, how many sessions the user triggered in a month, as well as how many articles they read, how many matches they have accessed, predictions that have been set.

As mentioned before we want to predict churn of users und understand its main drivers. Specifically you should:

- Estimate the number of returning & churned users for May 2018. You should create a table with 2 columns: user_id, exp_user_type that is stored in user_classified.csv
- What are the main factors that drive user churn? Do they make sense? Discuss your findings.
- In case you could add an additional variable to this data set that could help explain churn, which
one would it be and why?
